# Engineering Roles

## Role and Career Path distinctions

Before an Engineer enters a leadership role, be it technical or organizational, the above diagram and below descriptions indicate the level of skill and ability that has been demonstrated before finding themselves deciding between becoming a _Lead Engineer_ or a _Engineering Manager_, or between becoming a _Principal Engineer_ or an _Architect_.  In each of these positions that land as a result of the fork in the road, the critical difference is not in capabilities of the person considering the role, but in what is expected of them in each role. As such, it's important that the distinction of the differences between the roles is clear, not merely the expectation of the role itself.

### _Lead Engineer_ vs. _Engineering Manager_

* __Engineering Managers__ are responsible for the organization of a group of technical people around execution and delivery of software. This means their primary repsonsibility is managing people, process, discussions, meetings, and time. While they are technically skilled and able to accomplish the same kind of work as a Lead Engineer, their primary responsibility is for managing the organization. That does not mean they may not sometimes or often play the _Lead Engineer_ role within their group or their project, but it does mean their _responsibility and expectations_ are organizational, not technical.

* __Lead Engineers__ are responsible for the organization of the technical approach to implementing solutions. Being a Lead Engineer absolutely requires working and organizing people around a technical initative, ensuring the people of the appropriate skill level are tasked to the work before them, and that the work itself is clear and understood, and their team mates are technically supported by them. While often _Lead Engineers_ will play a part in developing organizational processes, helping organize people similar to an _Engineering Manager_ the primarily _responsibility and expectation_ is around the technology and the technical approach by which a solution is being solved, and the ability to scale the execution of an implementation across a group of people through coordinated design and execution not necessarily around the organization of the group. _Lead Engineers_ are also expected to play effective supporting roles in projects they are not leading.

## Software Engineer / System Engineer ##

*Note*:  Coming in the door, if a software engineer is fresh,
and/or young in his/her career we should assume that these skills are
not necessarily present and that they will need mentoring to develop
the skills outlined below.

### Solution Complexity ###

* Implement solutions whose complexity are at the scale single blocks of logic (e.g methods, functions, and procedures, queries)
* Implement solutions whose complexity involves integrating an navigating several components within an application.
* Implement additional components that fit into a larger pre-defined structure
* Implement solutions on top of existing or legacy code of afore mentioned complexity
* Diagnose bugs and implement fixes of nominal complexity
* Refactor unsustainably implemented code as encountered in the code base
