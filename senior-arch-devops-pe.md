You may not know every software language, tool, or design pattern but with a little help from Google and StackOverflow, you can learn a new things in a day and you're a subject matter expert in a week.  You reflexively write unit tests and can mentor a team of engineers in test driven development practices.  You design pragmatic, scalable architectures that are as simple as they should be (but no simpler!)  You use NoSQL and RDBMS technologies where and when they're appropriate, but you're not married to either.  You embrace DevOps philosophies and know that platform software in the 21st century is always evolving and never complete.  You champion security, scalability, and reliability throughout the software stack.  You are motivated by a commitment to writing understandable, maintainable, and reusable software.  You understand the application lifecycle and know that installation, configuration and deployment of application components is just as important as clean code.  You strive for quality and operational excellence.
